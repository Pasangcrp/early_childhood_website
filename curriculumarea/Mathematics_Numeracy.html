          <h2>Mathematics and Numeracy: Building Foundations for Creative Problem Solving</h2>
          <p>Mathematics and numeracy are essential for young children's cognitive development. These subjects help children develop logical thinking, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills. By integrating creative teaching strategies into mathematics lessons, teachers can encourage children to approach problems innovatively, fostering creativity alongside numerical skills. Early exposure to mathematical concepts through play, exploration, and hands-on activities promotes curiosity and cognitive flexibility, which are crucial for lifelong learning.</p>

        <h3>Creativity Theories and Perspectives in Mathematics Education</h3>
        <p>Creativity in mathematics can be framed through Piaget’s theory of cognitive development and Vygotsky’s social development theory. Piaget's emphasis on active exploration supports the idea that children learn mathematical concepts best through hands-on activities. Vygotsky’s theory highlights the importance of social interaction in the learning process, where children can discuss and explore mathematical concepts together, building their creativity and problem-solving abilities through collaborative learning.</p>

        <h3>Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h3>
        <p>Teachers can use various resources such as counting blocks, abacuses, geometric shapes, and number games to engage children in mathematics and numeracy. Digital tools like interactive math apps (e.g., "DragonBox" or "Khan Academy Kids") and websites can supplement traditional learning. Additionally, online tools like virtual manipulatives help children visualize mathematical concepts, enhancing creativity in problem-solving and fostering an understanding of abstract ideas.</p>
